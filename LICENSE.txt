           fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement of third party
           intellectual property rights or lack of viruses, for the Software. In
           no event will Univocity or its licensors be liable for any
           consequential, incidental, indirect, special, punitive, or other
           damages whatsoever arising out of this Agreement, the use of or
           inability to use the Software, even if Univocity has been advised of
           the possibility of such damages.

     13.7. The Software is not intended for use in the operation of military
           systems, any systems in industries which create offensive weapons,
           nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communications systems or
           air traffic control machines or any other machines in which case the

           severe physical or environmental damage.

     13.8. The User acknowledges that Univocity may pursue any available

  14. AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW

     14.1. Certain legislation including the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) in
           the Consumer and Competition Act 2010 (Cth), and similar consumer
           protection laws and regulations may confer you with rights,
           warranties, guarantees and remedies relating to the provision of
           services by us to you which cannot be excluded, restricted or
           modified (Statutory Rights).

     14.2. Nothing in these Terms removes your Statutory Rights as a consumer
           under the ACL. You agree that our liability for services provided to
           consumers is governed solely by the ACL and these Terms.  We exclude
           all conditions and warranties implied by custom, law or statute
           except for your Statutory Rights.

     14.3. Except for your Statutory Rights, all material and work is provided
           to you without warranties of any kind, either express or implied; and
           we expressly disclaim all warranties of any kind including but not
           limited to implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
           particular purpose.

     14.4. If you are a consumer as defined in the ACL, the following applies to
           you: We guarantee that the services we supply to you are rendered
           with due care and skill; fit for the purpose that we advertise, or
           that you have told us you are acquiring the services for or for a
           result which you have told us you wish the services achieve, unless
           we consider and disclose that this purpose is not achievable; and
           will be supplied within a reasonable time. To the extent we are
           unable to exclude liability; our total liability for loss or damage
           you suffer or incur from our services is limited to us re-supplying
           the services to you, or, at our option, us refunding to you the
           amount you have paid us for the services to which your claim relates.

  15. INDEMNITY

     15.1. You will be liable for and agree to indemnify, defend and hold us
           harmless for and against any and all claims, liabilities, suits,
           actions and expenses, including costs of litigation and reasonable
           legal costs, resulting directly or indirectly from:

        (i)   any information that is not accurate, up to date or complete or is
              misleading or a misrepresentation;

        (ii)  any breach of these Terms;

        (iii) and any misuse of the Software and/or License; from or by you,
              your employees, contractors or agents.

     15.2. You agree to co-operate with us (at your own expense) in the handling
           of disputes, complaints, investigations or litigation that arise as a
           result of your use of our Software and License including but not
           limited to disputes, complaints, investigations or litigation that
           arises out of or relates to incorrect information you have given us. 

     15.3. The obligations under this clause will survive termination of these
           Terms.

           or right or any other power or right.

     20.2. A Party is not liable to any other Party for any loss, cost or
           expense that may have been caused or contributed to by the failure,

           remedies of that Party. Nothing in this Agreement merges,
           extinguishes, postpones, lessens or otherwise prejudicially affects
           any power, right, or remedy that a Party may have at any time against
           the other Party to this Agreement or any other person.

  22. FORCE MAJEURE

     22.1. Neither Party will be liable for any delay in performing any of its
           obligations under this Agreement if such delay is caused by
           circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the party so delaying,
           and such party will be entitled to a reasonable extension of time for
           the performance of such obligations.

           withhold any consent or approval or give consent or approval
           conditionally or unconditionally.

  24. FURTHER ASSURANCE

     24.1. Each Party must from time to time and in a timely manner do all

           in question will not be affected.
